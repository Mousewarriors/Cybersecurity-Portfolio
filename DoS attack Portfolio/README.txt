DoS Incident Portfolio Summary

Summary (100 words):
I analyzed a Denial of Service (DoS) incident in which an external attacker flooded the organization’s network with ICMP packets, exploiting an unconfigured firewall and causing internal services to be unavailable for approximately two hours. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, I mapped the incident across Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions and recommended long-term improvements including firewall hardening, IDS/IPS deployment, monitoring enhancements, and recovery planning.

Skills Used:
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Application
- Risk & Business Impact Assessment
- Detection & Monitoring Strategy Design
- IDS/IPS and Network Security Controls
- Incident Documentation & Reporting
