SOC Investigation README

Investigation Summary:
I investigated a critical SOC274 alert involving exploitation of CVE-2024-3400 against a Palo Alto Networks firewall running PAN-OS 10.2.0. I analyzed HTTP, firewall, and OS-level telemetry logs and identified an external attacker (144.172.79.92) exploiting the GlobalProtect login endpoint using a malicious cookie containing path traversal and command injection payloads. I confirmed successful exploitation through HTTP 200 responses, internal process execution (dt_send, dt_curl), and attempted outbound callbacks, validating remote command execution on the firewall. I enriched the source IP with threat intelligence, confirmed malicious hosting infrastructure, classified the incident as a true positive breach, contained the affected firewall, escalated appropriately, and documented remediation and forensic recommendations.
